            <h3>Mentoring</h3>
            <p> FIRST also has its foot in the global community. In conjunction with the
                state department, FIRST Global was able to host the first ever "Robot Olympics"
                with over 160 teams attending from over 150 countries. In the months leading up
                to this epic competition, I helped mentor Team Honduras by Skyping every week
                and constantly communicating by email. Specifically, I helped to teach the students
                the art of coding through the use of Google's Blockly programming
                language. By the end of the competition, Team Honduras students were changing and improving
                robot functionality through code, all on their own! It was a challenge for everyone involved -
                Team Honduras students walked hours to school everyday to access
                materials and an internet connection and, for many of them, this was their first exposure to 
                aspects of STEM. For the mentors working with Team Honduras from the US, the language
                barrier and responsibilty of ensuring Team Honduras was field ready by the time 
                the Olympics came was a difficult, but ultimately a rewarding, experience.

            <h3>Competion Volunteering</h3>
            <p> When the Olympic Games finally rolled around, I made sure to be part of the 
                staff working to smoothly run the inagural First Global Compeition. 
                Due to my technical expertise, I worked with the "Flying Squad" to anticipate 
                and solve any technical mishaps teams would inevitably experience at competition.
                Whether helping teams while queueing for matches, or running to a team's pit (area
                where teams would work on their robot and store tools), each individual interaction, 
                no matter how small, was humbling and eye opening - everyone on this planet is human,
                and none of us are so different as to justify discrimination or hate against one another.
