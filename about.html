                    <p> Hi, I'm Joshua Sizer, a student at Wissahickon High School. I live
                        in the suburbs of Philiadelphia in a town called Ambler. Born in South
                        Africa, I had the opportunity to migrate to the United States when I was 
                        a few months old. My father, then working at Rohm and Haas as a software
                        developer, has influenced and inspired both my brother's and my own
                        passion for science, technology, and more specifically,
                        computer science.

            <h1>Interests</h1>
            <h2>Technology</h2>
            <p> From the time I was a few years old, I would ask for Star Wars lego sets
                as birthday gifts. The idea that building blocks could come together
                to create something greater than the sum of their parts was exciting
                to me. As I progressed through school grades, I was exposed to FLL,
                <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/fll?__hstc=208832909.fcdbe9cf53d00f66c183541635fa9922.1503343280143.1503343280143.1503343280143.1&__hssc=208832909.2.1503343280143&__hsfp=761709926">FIRST Lego League</a>
                and then FRC, <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc" >FIRST Robotics Competition</a>. 
                I enrolled in our high school's FRC team, <a href="http://www.team341.com/">Team 341 Miss Daisy</a>
                as soon as I was able. Throughout my years on the team, I have learned and been inspired by STEM.
                More important than that, Miss Daisy has taught me how to teach, lead, and listen. </p>

            <h2>Music</h2>    
            <p> Apart from STEM,
                music plays a large part in my life. You'll rarely catch me without headphones within a five foot radius,
                and playing guitar is my go to stress reliever. Learning and performing other's songs has always been
                beneificial to improving my skill set, but my favorite part of playing guitar is the creative process. I became
                addicted to recording, mixing, and mastering my own music, and I hope to continue throughout college.</p>
