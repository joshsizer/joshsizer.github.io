            <h2>FIRST Robotics</h2>
            <p> Throughout my time on <a href="http://team341.com">FIRST Robotics Team 341, Miss Daisy</a>, I have been able to pursue my passion in STEM through programming, mechanical engineering, and photography. Aside from the practical skills attained from this team, I have learned the importance of strong communication and effective leadership. My teammates were more than just people I worked with; they were family. Miss Daisy doesn't just build robots, they build people.
