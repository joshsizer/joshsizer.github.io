            <h3>Mentoring</h3>
            <p> FIRST also has its foot in the global community. In conjunction with the state department, FIRST Global was able to host the first-ever "Robot Olympics" with over 160 teams attending from over 150 countries. In the months leading up to this epic competition, I helped mentor Team Honduras by Skyping every week and constantly communicating by email. Specifically, I helped to teach the students the art of coding through the use of Google's Blockly programming language. By the end of the competition, Team Honduras students were changing and improving robot functionality through code, all on their own! It was a challenge for everyone involved - Team Honduras students walked hours to school every day to access materials and an internet connection and, for many of them, this was their first exposure to aspects of STEM. For the mentors working with Team Honduras from the US, the language barrier and responsibility of ensuring Team Honduras was field ready by the time the Olympics came was a difficult, but ultimately a rewarding, experience.

            <h3>Competion Volunteering</h3>
            <p> When the Olympic Games finally rolled around, I made sure to be part of the 
                staff working to smoothly run the inaugural First Global Competition. 
                Due to my technical expertise, I worked with the "Flying Squad" to anticipate 
                and solve any technical mishaps teams would inevitably experience at the competition.
                Whether helping teams while queueing for matches, or running to a team's pit (area
                where teams would work on their robot and store tools), each individual interaction, 
                no matter how small, was humbling and eye-opening - everyone on this planet is human 
                and we are all more similar than we are different.

            <p> Delivering food to elderly not only keeps them eating healthy, but ensures 
                they have consistent human interaction each day of the week. As a runner,
                I had the honor of hand delivering meals, and each interaction was unique
                and satisfying.
