            <p> Hi, I'm Joshua Sizer! As a student at Wissahickon High School,
                I spend my time learning, studying, working, and participating.

            <h2>Code</h2>
            <p> First and foremost, I am an aspiring developer. 
                I have a passion to create functional, elegant 
                code that does more than just work. Through higher
                eduction, I hope to learn best practices and guiding
                principals, as well as build a strong foundation
                for self learning. With exciting new technologies emerging 
                each and everyday - tools, frameworks, and even 
                programming languages - staying on top is 
                necessary to remain relevant. These new technologies
                excite me, and I hope to gain the skill set required
                for embracing them.

        <h2>Music</h2>
            <p> When I'm not developing code, you'll be sure to find
                me sporadically playing notes on my guitar until I 
                find a melody or chord that excites me... then I'll 
                record it, program drums, mix, and master to taste.
                Music production and code are alike - and both fuel
                my desire to create.

            <h2>Robotics</h2>
            <p> Since the moment I could sign up for the school's 
                robotics team as a freshman, I have been heavily 
                involved in FRC Robotics Team 341, Miss Daisy.

            <h2>Volunteer Service</h2>
            <p> My time on Miss Daisy involved numerous 
                demonstrations and outreach events with 
                the goal of inspiring the youth and exposing
                them to STEM. In a similar fashion, I helped
                mentor FIRST Global team Honduras in the first 
                ever "Robot Olympics". I also participate in
                local Meals on Wheels as a way for community
                involvment.
